            <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
            <p>I started to learn to code due to my curiosity to understand what tech people do and in the process,
            fell in love with SQL and Python. Currently I am learning SQL, Python and Tableau. I have completed two courses with Code First Girls (CFG): Intro to Data and SQL
            and Intro to Python and Apps. Also, I am doing self-learning, completed The Complete SQL Bootcamp: Go from Zero
            to Hero, currently immersed with 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.</p>

            <h3>Recruitment</h3>
            <p class="recruit-p">I have 3 years of experience in technical recruitment and placed talented candidates across Software Engineering,
            QA, DevOps, Data and Security in Europe and APAC. During my time as a tech recruiter, I worked closely with hiring managers
            to conduct and align on market mapping, outreach strategy and candidate experience. I also used data-driven metrics
